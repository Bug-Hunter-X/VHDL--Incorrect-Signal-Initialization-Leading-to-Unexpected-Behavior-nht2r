# VHDL: Incorrect Signal Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in VHDL code: incorrect initialization of internal signals.  Improper initialization can lead to unpredictable results, especially in designs with asynchronous resets or complex state machines. The bug is present in the `bug.vhd` file.

## Bug Description
The initial value of the `internal_data` signal is set to `x"00"`,  but this isn't necessarily the correct default state for all conditions.  This may lead to unexpected behavior during the first few clock cycles, particularly if the reset is not immediately followed by valid data input. 

## Solution
The solution is provided in `bugSolution.vhd`.  The corrected code provides a more robust initialization strategy depending on design requirements.

## How to Reproduce
1. Compile and simulate `bug.vhd`. Observe unexpected output behavior at the beginning of the simulation.
2. Compile and simulate `bugSolution.vhd`. Verify that the correct behavior is achieved.
